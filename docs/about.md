# About Drupal Operator

The main idea of the Drupal Operator comes from [thom](https://github.com/thom8) and [geerlingguy](https://github.com/geerlingguy). And with the basic ideas on their work we started to build an operator for Drupal to have a consistent workflow  on deploying Drupal sites to a Kubernetes cluster. 

The Drupal Operator has been developed by Digitalist Sweden, mainly by [mikkeschiren](https://github.com/mikkeschiren) and [digitole](https://github.com/digitole).

The Drupal Operator is licensed under the same license as [operator-sdk](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk), Apache License 2.0.
